# WTFlux???

Many first encounters with the [FLUX design pattern](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html) result in temporary blindness of the mind, followed by roughly the same thought: "uhhh...what?". well I am here to tell you to fear not! by the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

* install a basic `node server`
* clone this repository onto your local machine
* get up and running with a basic FLUX application
* understand the fundamental FLUX design concepts
* love reactjs <3333

## Quickstart
While explaining all of the different components of this application can be difficult, getting up and running with this application is relatively painless. in order to follow this tutorial, we assume that you have [nodejs](need_link) and [npm](need_link) installed on your computer, and that you are capable of accessing the [command line from your machine.](need_link)

```bash
# change into the folder where you want your project
$ cd /your/sandbox/dir
# clone this repository onto your computer
$ git clone https://github.com/avocadojesus/react-flux-walkthrough.git
# precompile your assets
$ gulp build
# start your node server
$ node index
```

That's it! now you can navigate to `http://localhost:4000` to view your installed application!

## Prerequisites
* [nodejs](need_link)
* [npm](need_link)
* [command line](need_link)
* [git](need_link)
